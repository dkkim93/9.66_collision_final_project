\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We have developed model that aimed to understand human capabilities in the task of pedestrian intent estimation. The analysis of a neural network and HMM shows that humans strongly rely on euclidean distance and inferred pedestrian heading to predict a possible collision in between two pedestrians. We have augmented a classic neural network to reason about its' predictive uncertainty. In comparison to a classic model, the uncertainty-aware model more closely resembles human prediction, because it is able to \textit{know what it doesn't know}.

\section{Work Division} \label{sec:work-division}
The tasks were split evenly and all decisions and analyses were taken jointly. 
% Bj\"orn has focused on the implementation of the pedestrian simulation, Rose on the implementation of HMM and Dong-Ki on the neural network implementation.
